UShER is a program for rapid, accurate placement of samples to existing phylogenies. It is available `here <https://github.com/yatisht/usher>` and is updated regularly. While not restricted to SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analyses, it has enabled real-time phylogenetic analyses and genomic contact tracing in that its placement is orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than previous methods, and is being widely used by several SARS-CoV-2 research groups.
