UShER is a program for rapid, accurate placement of samples to existing phylogenies. Information on installation, usage, and features `can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UShER.html>`_. Our `manuscript about UShER can be found here <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.314971v1.abstract>`_.


.. _matUtils:


matUtils
============

matUtils is a toolkit for querying, interpreting and manipulating the mutation-annotated trees (MATs). `Information on its usage can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matUtils.html>`_.



matOptimize
============

matOptimize is a program to rapidly and effectively optimize a mutation-annotated tree (MAT) for parsimony using subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) moves within a user-defined radius. `Information on its usage can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matOptimize.html>`_.


RIPPLES
============

RIPPLES is a program that uses a phylogenomic technique to rapidly and sensitively detect recombinant nodes and their ancestors in a mutation-annotated tree (MAT). `Information on its usage can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ripples.html>`_.
