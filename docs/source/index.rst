UShER is a program for rapid, accurate placement of samples to existing phylogenies. Information on installation, usage, and features `can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UShER.html>`_. Our `manuscript about UShER can be found here <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.314971v1.abstract>`_.


.. _matUtils:


matUtils
============

matUtils is a set of tools to be used for analyses relating to **m**\ utation\  **a**\ nnotated\  **t**\ rees, such as the protobuf (.pb) files used in UShER. `Information on its usage can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matUtils.html>`_.


.. _Strain_Phylogenetics:


Strain_Phylogenetics Package
================================

We have developed several auxiliary tools for phylogenetic analysis in the *strain_phylogenetics* package, `which is available here <https://github.com/yatisht/strain_phylogenetics>`_. Information on `its constituent programs and their usage can be found here <https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Strain_Phylogenetics.html>`_.
