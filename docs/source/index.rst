UShER is a program for rapid, accurate placement of samples to existing phylogenies. It is available for downloading `here <https://github.com/yatisht/usher>`_ and is updated regularly. While not restricted to SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analyses, it has enabled real-time phylogenetic analyses and genomic contact tracing in that its placement is orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than previous methods, and is being widely used by several SARS-CoV-2 research groups, including the `UCSC Genome Browser team <https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace>`_ and `Rob Lanfear's global phylogeny releases <https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/releases>`_.

matUtils
=========

matUtils is a set of tools to be used for analyses relating to **`m`**utation **`a`**notated **`t`**rees, such as the protobuf (.pb) files used in UShER. This toolkit is currently under development and will be publicized shortly.
